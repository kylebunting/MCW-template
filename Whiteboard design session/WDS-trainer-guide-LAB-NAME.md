## Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

### Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

- Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.
- Stimulates the participant's thinking.
- Involves the participant in the learning process.
- Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).
- Ensures individual participant accountability.
- Ties it all together for the participant.
- Provides insight and experience to the learning process.
- Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.
- Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.
- Effectively leads the feedback process.

### Whiteboard design session flow

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

#### Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)

**Outcome**: Analyze your customer's needs

- Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements
- Current customer infrastructure and architecture
- Potential issues, objectives and blockers

#### Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)

**Outcome**: Prepare to present a solution for your target customer audience

- Determine your target customer audience
- Determine customer's business needs to address your solution
- Design and diagram your solution
- Prepare to present your solution

#### Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)

**Outcome**: Present solution to your customer

- Present solution
- Respond to customer objections
- Receive feedback

#### Wrap-up (15 minutes)

- Review preferred solution

### Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide
- Become familiar with all key points and activities.
- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.
- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.
- Make notes for later.

### During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.
- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.
- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

**Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

  - Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.

### Step 3: Present the solution
